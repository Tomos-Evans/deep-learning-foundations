    "In order to find the line that cuts the data in the \"best\" place (i.e. splits the classes most clearly) we can use **Gradient Decent**. A line is drawn randomly, and the number of errors (or later, the error value) is measurd. Then, we preform gradient decent on this error value in order to minimise the error, resulting in a line that seperates the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Error Function** that was mentioned is more complex than simply counting the number of incorrectly classified points. Instead, it works on a penalty system, where correctly classified points recieve a small penaty, and incorrect point recieve a very large penalty. This system takes into account the whole data space, which is good. \n",
